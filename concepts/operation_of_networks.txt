HOW DOES IT WORK PROTOCOLS OF SECURITY AND THE METHODS OF AUTHENTICATION IN WIRELESS NETWORK?

THROUGH OF DEVICES AS SMARTPHONES, NOTEBOOKS, COMPUTERS, TABLETS AMONG OTHERS DEVICES THAT
POSSES NETWORK CARD, IS POSSIBLE SENT E RECEIVE SIGNAL IN OTHERS WORDS SENT AND RECEIVE DATA
BY MEANS WIRELESS AND CONNECT IN NETWORKS.

EXIST DIVERS PROTOCOLS OF NETWORK AND METHODS OF AUTHENTICATION FOR THEY,
THE PROTOCOLS THEY: WPA(WIRELESS PROTECTED ACCESS), WPA2(WIRELESS PROTECTED ACCESS 2 WITH CRIPTOGRAPHY ADVANCED),
WPA3(WIRELESS PROTECTED ACCESS 3 CRIPTOGRAPHY ADVANCED AND VERY MUCH SAFE). EXIST OTHERS
VARIATIONS OF THIS PROTOCOLS FOR TO ADPTER IN DIFERENTS CENARYS. EACH ONE CAN OWN METHOD OF 
AUTHTENTICATION FOR THEY 

BUT I'LL GO TALK ABOUT WPA2 AND THE METHOD USED FOR COMMUNICATION SECURE THROUGH DEVICE AND ROUTER,
USED FOR EXEMPLE: FOR DEVICE SEND KEY OR DATA FOR ROUTER FOR CONNECT AT NETWORK OR FOR THE TWO
TO COMMUNICATE.

FOR THE DEVICE CONNECT AT NETWORK THROUGH IS NECESSARY AUTHENTICATION, AND EXIST DIVERS METHODS
OF AUTHENTICATION FOR ADPTER IN BETTER CENARY AND OTHER VARIATIONS OF PROTOCOLS THAT USES OTHER
METHODS OF AUTHENTICATION, I'LL GO TALK OF THE PSK METHOD:

PSK(PRE SHARED KEY) IS A PASSWORD KEY FROM THE NETWORK AND IS USED FOR AUTHENTICATE DEVICES IN NETWORK,
BUT DURING THE AUTHENTICATION AND THE PROCCESS OF HANDSHAKE-4WAY IS ESTABLISHED A KEY CRYPTOGRAPHIC
FOR PROTECT THE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN DEVICE CLIENT AND GATEWAY ROUTER, THE DEVICE CLIENT SEND
INFORMATION CRYPTOGRAFED WITH THE KEY CRYPTOGRAPHIC DERIVED FROM THE PSK KEY OF THE NETWORK, AND THE
ROUTER RECEIVE INFORMATION AND DECRYPT WITH PSK KEY MAIN

BUT HOW DOES IT WORK THE NETWORK CONNECTION?

DETAILS IMPORTANTS, HOW WHAT OCCUR DURING THE COMMUNICATION:

WHEN DEVICE WITH PLAQUE NETWORK TRY CONNECT AT NETWORK, OCCUR A VERY EXCHANGEND DATA OF PACKETS WITH
INFORMATIONS IMPORTANTS FOR IDENTIFICATION AND FOR GOOD COMMUNICATION AND SAFE.

THE MAIN DATAS EXCHANGE ARE: ADDRESS MAC THROUGH SOURCE AND DESTINY OF THE PACKTS, FLAGS USEDS
FOR SINALIZATE COMMUNICATON AND NAME OF THE DEVICES OR NAMES OF THE PLAQUE NETWORK.

THE PROCCESS:

FIRST START WITH THE PROCCESS OF HANDSHAKE 4-WAYS FOR ESTABLISH A CONNECTION BETWEEN CLIENT 
AND ROUTER IN NETWORK, THE HANDSHAKE-4WAY IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT OF THE HANDSHAKE STANDARD WELL-KNOW
HANDSHAKE 3-WAYS USED IN CONNECTIONS TCP/IP, BUT WHAT IS A HANDSHAKE ?

HANDSHAKE IS IT  NAME GIVEN TO THE PROCCESS OF CONNECTION AND COMMUNICATON BETWEEN A COMPUTERS IN NETWORK
OR A DEVICE AND OUTHER DEVICE, BUT FOR THIS IS NECESSARY WHAT OWN FLAGS AND SIGNALS QUE INDICATE
AND TO INFORM THE COMPUTERS BETWEEN AT COMMUNICATION.

THE SIGNALS THAT COMPUTERS SENT FOR INDICATE THE PROCCESS OF THE HANDSHAKE FOR CONNECTION OR
COMMUNICATION, SIGNALS THEY ARE:

SYN: (SYNCHRONIZE) WHEN A COMPUTER SENT PACKET FOR OTHER COMPUTER OR WHEN TRY CONNECT THE A OTHER
COMPUTER OR COMMUNICATE. SIMPLIFYING: SYN: A COMPUTER TRY (SYN) ON ANOTHER COMPUTER.

ACK: (ACKNOWLEDGE) WHEN A COMPUTER THAT RECEIVE A PACKET OR INFORMATION IN OTHER WORDS ANSWERED
A COMPUTER WHAT SENT SYN, INFORMING HIM THAT RECEIVED THE INFORMATION. SIMPLIFING: ACK: COMPUTER RESPONDS (ACK) FOR TO INFORM THAT RECEIVE INFORMATION.

SYN-ACK: (SYNCHRONIZE-ACKNOWLEDGE) WHEN A COMPUTER RECEIVE WITH SUCEFULL A PACKET
THEN IT WAS DEFINED THE CONNECTION OR COMMUNICATION. SIMPLIFYNG: SYN-ACK: WHEN COMPUTER RECEIVE AND ACCEPT COMMUNICATIONS OR CONNECTION.

FIN: (FINISH) SERVE FOR INDICATE THAT THE CONNECTION OR COMMUNICATION IS HAS BE CLOSED, ENCERRED.

EXIST OTHERS FLAGS FOR INDICATE THE PROCCESS OF THE HANDSHAKE.

HANDSHAKE SUCEFULL!!!

NOW THE PROCCESS OF HANDSHAKE 4-WAY:

1 - DEVICE TRY AT CONNECT AT NETWORK: SEND SOLICITATION EAPOL-START OR HANDSHAKE 1 FOR ROUTER OR 
    ACCESS POINT.

2 - THE ROUTER RECEIVE E RESPOND(RESPONSE) WITH A CHALLANGE IN OTHER WORDS ASKING AUTHENTICATION
OR  KEY FOR CONNECT WITH AT NETWORK, EAPOL-MESSAGE 2 OR HANDSHAKE 2.

3 - THE DEVICE PLATE OF NETWORK, THE IS SENT KEY OR DATA REQUIRED NEEDED BY ROUTER FOR CONNECTION AT NETWORK, EAPOL-MESSAGE 3 OR HANDSHAKE 3.

4 - THE ROUTER(ACCESS POINT) RECEIVE THE KEY AND TRYING TO VALIDATE AND COMPARE WITH THE KEY FROM AT NETWORK, AND THEN SEND INFORMATION FOR DEVICE THAT TRYING TO CONNECT IF THE DATA IS VALID OR NOT OR IF IT WAS POSSIBLE THE CONNECTION, EAPOL-MESSAGE 4 OR HANDSHAKE 4. 

DETAIL, ONLY IS POSSIBLE INTERCEPT THE DATA EXCHANGE THROUGH PLAQUE NETWORK AND ROUTER AND INTERNET
FROM YOUR PLAQUE OF NETWORK AND ACCESS POINT OR COMPUTERS, OR FROM THE COMPUTER THAT YOU HAVE ACCESS!

DERIVDED KEY OF THE PSK: PMK(Pairwise Master key): key of encrypty 

modes of the adapters wifi:

monitor mode: capture all traffic of network, through your computer and AP network.

managed: Defalt mode, used for you connect in network normally.
