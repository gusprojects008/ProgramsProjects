HOW WHAT WORKING THE SMARTPHONES?

THE SMARTPHONE IS A COMPUTER JUST LIKE ANY OTHER, OWN CPU, MEMORY, STORAGE AND ALL HARDWARE 
NECESSARY. BUT WITH LIMITATIONS OF PROCESSING AND OTHERS BECAUSE OF THE CONTEXT AND REASON
PURPOSE FOR CREATING FROM HIM, THE SMARTPHONE BE CRATED FOR TO BE ACESSIBLE, SAFE, EASY USABILITY
FOR RECEIVE SUPPORT OF THE DEVELOPERS FOR STABILITY AND SECURITY.

LIKE THIS THE COMPUTERS IN GENERAL THE SMARTPHONE IT IS DIVIDED INTO LAYERS FOR IT TO FUNCTION:

BASICALLY THE SMARTPHONES IN GENERAL IS DIVIDED IN: FIRMWARE WITH BOOTLOADER, SYSTEM OPERATIONAL WIRH UI.

EXPLAINING MORE DEEP:

FIRMWARE IS RESPONSIBLE	FOR TO CONTROL THE HARDWARE OF THE SMARTPHONE, THE FIRMWARE OWN A SET
PROGRAMS FOR HANDLE THE SMARTPHONE, HOW DOES THE BOOTLOADER WORK FOR INIT AS FILES OF THE SYSTEM
OPERATIONAL CORRECTLY AND LOAD THE SYSTEM OPERATIONAL.

SYSTEM OPERATIONAL IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ARE THE INTERMEDIARY BETWEEN THE HARDWARE OF THE SMARTPHONE
AND THE SOFTWARES, HER OWN A SET PROGRAMS THAT CAN ALLOWS THE USER INTERACT WITH HARDWARE OF WAY
FRIENDLY FOR ALSO THAT MAKES IT POSSIBLE THE USE AND INTERACTION AND EXECUTION OF THE PROGRAMS AND SOFTWARES, GAMES ETC...

IN HIM IT IS FORMED:

KERNEL: IS RESPONSIBLE FOR BEING THE INTERMEDIARY BETWEEN THE HARDWARE AND SYSTEM OPERATIONAL,
HER TO MANAGE: BATTERY POWER, PROCCESS, MEMORY, STORAGE, NETWORK AND PERMISSIONS OF THE USER,
HANDLING ALL COMPONENTS FOR TO DO OPERATIONS AND EXECUTIONS OF THE SOFTWARES, PROGRAMS ETC...
AND WITH HER IS POSSIBLE THAT THE UI(INTERFACE USER) USES AND ACCESS AND INTERACT WITH FUNCTIONS
OF THE KERNEL LIKE THIS CAN OPERATE HANDLE THE SMARTPHONE.

UI: BUT FOR A USERS TO HAVE A INTERACTION EASY AND ACCESSIBLE IS CREATED THE UI(INTERFACE USER)
WITH HER IS POSSIBLE TO DO OPERATIONS, PLAY, INTERACT EASY WITH SMARTPHONE THROUGH TOUCH SCREEN,
USING THE FUNCTIONALITYS OF THE KERNEL LIKE THIS HANDLING AND USING SMARTPHONE OF WAY FRIENDLY.

IN GENERAL IS THIS, BUT WE CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER:

HOW WHAT IS DIVIDED THE SYSTEM OPERATIONAL IN OTHERS WORDS WHAT IS NEEDED FOR CONSTITUTE FORM
THE SYSTEM OPERATIONAL ANDROID FOR EXEMPLE.

A SYSTEM OPERATIONAL ANDROID IS A FILE .ISO AND WHAT FORM A FILE .ISO?

A FILE .ISO IS IMAGE OF THE SYSTEM OPERATIONAL ANDROID AND IN HIM OWN ARCHIVERS THAT FORM HER.

IN THIS FILES OWN PROGRAMS AND THE NECESSARY FOR FORM THE SYSTEM OPERATIONAL 

THE FILES ARE:

AP(PDA - PHONE): THIS IS THE FILE THAT OWN THE MAIN PART, THE KERNEL AND THE APPLICATIONS STANDARD
                 AND BLOOTWARES.

BL(BOOTLOADER): IS FILE THAT CONTAINS THE INSTRUTIONS OF INICIALIZATION OF THE PROGRAMS AND
                COMPONENTS NECESSARYS FOR THE INITALIZATION OF THE SYSTEM OPERATIONAL CORRECTLY.

CP(CONSUMER SOFTWARE COMMUNICATION): CP(COMMUNICATION SOFTWARE CONSUMER): THIS FILE IS RESPONSIBLE BY COMMUNICATION OF THE SMARTPHONE,
                                     HE CONTAINS THE DATA AND SOFTWARES FOR HANDLING THE DEVICES OF COMMUNICATION
                                     HARDWARE, FOR EXEMPLE: BLUETOOTH, WIFI AND OTHERS RECURSES OF COMMUNICATION,
                                     THAT'S WHY HER OWN DRIVERS AND IN HIM NEEDED BE UPDATE FOR ASSURE
                                     THAT WORKING CORRECTLY.

CSC(CUSTOMIZATION SOFTWARE CONSUMER): IN THIS FILE THAT CONTAINS DATA ABOUT CARRIER CHIP AND PAIS
                                      AND PROGRAMAS FOR CUSTOMIZE 


WITH ALL FILES THAT THE IMAGE ISO OF THE SYSTEM ANDROID.
