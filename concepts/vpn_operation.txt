HOW DOES A VPN(VIRTUAL PRIVATE NETWORK) WORK?

VPN (VIRTUAL PRIVATE NETWORK) IS USED TO PROTECT YOUR COMMUNICATION WITH THE INTERNET OR ENABLE
USE THE INTERNET FROM A SPECIFIC PLACE IN THE WORLD, BEING ABLE TO ENCRYPTE YOUR COMMUNICATION
WITH THE INTERNET, BY CONNECTING YOU TO A VPN SERVER ANOTHER PLACE IN THE WORLD, OR CREATING A
TUNEL CONNECTION WITH A REMOTE COMPUTER THUS CHANGING YOUR PUBLIC IP TO THE INTERNET AND YOUR PROVIDER
PROVIDING MORE SECURITY AND PRIVACY, BECAUSE YOU ARE COMMUNICATING WITH THE INTERNET THROUGH
FROM ANOTHER MACHINE FROM A CONNECTION TO THE VPN SERVER USING TCP OR UDP PROTOCOLS
OR OTHERS FOR COMMUNICATION BETWEEN YOU AND THE VPN SERVER.

THIS IS POSSIBLE TO ACCESS FILES AND RESOURCES THAT ARE ONLY AVAILABLE IN ONE PLACE ON THE
SPECIFIC WORLD, VIA THE INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER(ISP) OF THE LOCATED VPN SERVER
IN A SPECIFIC PLACE IN THE WORLD.

COMMUNICATION PROCESS WITH VPN SERVER (VIRTUAL PRIVATE NETWORK):

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

YOU NEED TO BE CONNECTED TO THE SERVER!
PROTOCOLS: TCP, UDP, IPSEC, L2TP, PPTP, SSTP AND OTHERS FOR COMMUNICATION WITH THE VPN SERVER!

					INTERNET EM GERAL:

	INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS USED TO DIRECT INFORMATION CORRECTLY
 	TO OTHER SERVERS SUCH AS DNS SERVERS(DOMAIN NAME SERVER) TO STORE
	INTERNET SERVER DOMAIN NAMES. HOW... EXAMPLE.COM, FOR YOU TO GET TO THE SERVER
	EXEMPLO.COM AND COMMUNICATE WITH THE SERVER BY SENDING AND RECEIVING RESPONSES, IT IS MADE A GREAT
	COMMUNICATION ROUTE WITH YOU AND THE SERVER, BRIEF EXPLANATION:

 	YOU CONNECT TO THE SERVER'S PRIVATE VIRTUAL NETWORK CREATING A COMMUNICATION TUNNEL BETWEEN YOU
	AND THE VPN SERVER THEN YOU SEND THE INFORMATION, THE INFORMATION IS PASSED DIRECTLY TO THE SERVER
	VPN THE VPN SERVER ENCRYPTES AND FORWARDS THE INFORMATION TO THE VPN SERVER'S LOCAL ISP AND THE
	VPN SERVER'S ISP ROUTES THROUGH THE DEFINED OR SPECIFIC PATH OF THE SERVER'S ISP
	VPN, BUT AS AN EXAMPLE THE VPN SERVER'S ISP DIRECTS YOUR INFORMATION TO THE DNS SERVER IN CASE
	WHETHER YOU ARE SENDING INFORMATION OR ACCESSING A SERVER WITH A SPECIFIC DOMAIN NAME,
	THEN THE DNS SERVER SEARCHES FOR THE DOMAIN NAME AND RETURNS THE SITE HOSTED WITH THE SPECIFIC NAME,
	THE WAY TO SEND INFORMATION TO YOUR COMPUTER IS MADE THROUGH INVERSION, THE
	RESPONSE INFORMATION FROM THE DESTINATION SERVER IS SENT TO THE VPN SERVER'S ISP AND SO
	SENT TO THE VPN SERVER AND FROM THE VPN SERVER TO YOUR MACHINE, ALL SECURELY
	AND ENCRYPTED.

 	IN THE END YOU ONLY USE YOUR LOCAL ISP'S INTERNET CONNECTION TO CONNECT TO A NETWORK
	VIRTUAL PRIVATE ON A SERVER AND CREATE A COMMUNICATION TUNNEL FOR YOUẼ THEN COMMUNICATE
