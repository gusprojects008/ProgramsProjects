Steganography is a technique for hiding a message, such as passwords, links, files, or other sensitive information, inside another file, usually an image.

But what is an image? In fact, an image is a large set of binary data, made up of 0s and 1s, forming a large matrix. This data defines the values ​​of each pixel in the pixel grid. Each pixel typically has 3 bytes, and each byte has a value from 0 to 255, representing the tone level of the pixel's RGB colors (red, green, blue). By combining and mixing each pixel with a different tone, it is possible to form an image.

Image extensions are responsible for defining how image data is organized and how it should be processed. Each image extension has different methods and ways of organizing image data. The computer identifies and decodes the image correctly according to its extension and format (jpg, png, etc.) through the Processor (CPU) and renders the pixels and their shadows on the monitor through the GPU, finally displaying the image on the screen.

EXIF (Exchangeable Image File Format) is the standard format responsible for storing and assigning basic data to an image, such as the date and time the image was created, location, origin, camera name, and more. "EXIF data" is known as metadata and is used for various purposes, such as forensics, photo organization programs (gallery, Google Photos), etc.

With this, it is possible to add information to images, extract it, replace it, or delete it by opening and manipulating an image's EXIF metadata.

Through programs as imageMagic, exiftool, binwalk, steghide, stegseek between others is possible interact with the metadatas from image, extracting, putting, replacing or delete.
